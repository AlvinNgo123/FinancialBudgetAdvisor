The virtual advisor will ask the user a series of questions that will help it understand what the user's current budget is like and how much it should adjust that budget. At the end, the user will be provided a budget that they can utilize to keep their finances in check."

    "1. My Python background is fairly basic. I've used python before when running some basic scripts but I've coded mostly in other languages since the CS courses at UCSD don't teach you in Python. Therefore, despite being familiar with the majority of the CS fundamentals, I felt this class really allowed me to focus down on the unique syntax and nuanaces of Python.\n",
    "2. I felt that I was able to really challenge myself in the testing of the project. Since I started the project fairly early, my code format involved using the python input function which didn't allow for the normal way of testing. While the project requirement was to test just 2 functions (at least), I wanted to try and test every function in my program. With this goal in mind, I had to learn about mocking user input and knowing when and how to pass those inputs into our functions to test them properly. The code example that really guided me through this process is linked here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56300124/how-efficiently-unit-test-a-function-with-multiple-input-calls "
